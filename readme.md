## What in the five flaming hells?!?

The Finer Things is an article/review website that I'm working on to publish my thoughts, feelings and 
general critique of "the finer things in life". This will include wines, whiskeys/scotches, cigars, 
cafe/restaurant reviews and more.

Why build it from scratch? Because I want to model the domain and practise many of the things I've learnt
as a result of this new study period. That plus - I love building things!

This repository will act as an example of the project code as well as a working example of the newest Laravel
5 features, utilising command buses, proper event streams, model events (such as count caches) and probably
a few other features, as well.
