## What in the five flaming hells?!?

The Finer Things is an article/review website that I'm working on to publish my thoughts, feelings and 
general critique of "the finer things in life". This will include wines, whiskeys/scotches, cigars, 
cafe/restaurant reviews and more.

Why build it from scratch? Because I want to model the domain and practise many of the things I've learnt
as a result of this new study period. That plus - I love building things!

This repository will act as an example of the project code as well as a working example of domain-driven 
design at work, utilising many concepts including event sourcing, CQRS and more.

Feel free to post questions in the Issues section of the repository and I'll answer when I get time :)
